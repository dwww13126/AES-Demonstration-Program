# AES-Demonstration-Program

Project from COMPX518 Cyber Security where we were tasked in creating a Java program which encrypts the content of an image to visually demonstrate the effectiveness of Electronic Codebook (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) and Cipher Feedback (CFB) modes of AES encryption.

## Setup Instructions

1. Compile: "javac AESImageEncryption.java"

2. Run the program: "java AESImageEncryption <NameOfImage>.<ExtensionOfImage>"

3. Open up the outputted CBC, CFB and ECB JPEG files to see the results
